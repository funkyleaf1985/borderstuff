Jovontae Turner is a legend in the skate game. He’s an innovator of style with both his trick selection and fashion sense. Given that DGK has collaborated with Jovontae in the past on a deck that re-appropriated one of his classic graphics and the close ties that Tae has with the crew; it was only right to do this DGK X JT&CO capsule collection.
