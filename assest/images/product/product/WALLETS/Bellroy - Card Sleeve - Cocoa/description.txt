The Card Sleeve is the slimmest style in the Bellroy range and perfect for use as a business card holder or those who don't muck around in the wallet contents department. The main section features a pull tab for easy storage of cards and money, while the outside pockets can be used for quick-access items. True to the saying, good things do indeed come in small packages.
