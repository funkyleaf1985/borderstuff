As one of DC's most technologically advanced skate shoes so far, Chris Cole's new signature model, the DC Cole Lite 2 is packed with progressive features and clean styling. It's a lightweight cupsole with a clean toe and no-sew upper to help prevent blowouts, creating a longer-lasting shoe. It also features custom footbed graphics and tongue logo, along with the all-new Dual-lite density EVA midsole that provides more cushioning and protection.
