Not since HUFs design back in 2004 has the Nike SB Dunk High made use of tie-dye uppers. Luckily for us, the skate wing brings back the classic American print in a color-less black-and-white scheme, a gum outsole, and a multi-colored tongue label. Definitely an eye-catcher if you’re a Dunk fan, or if you never got to own a pair of the HUFs from a decade ago! - sneakernews.com
