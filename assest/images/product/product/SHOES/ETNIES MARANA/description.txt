Charging the best skate spots all over the world, Ryan Sheckler deserves a long-lasting shoe that can keep up with him wherever he goes. The new etnies Marana was designed to blend strength and style, making it the perfect shoe for a Ryan Sheckler signature style. It was carefully crafted, piece by piece, to endure skateboarding. Its fused-on injected rubber toe cap makes it super hard to wear through, the lightweight and impact-resistant STI Evolution™ Foam midsole doesn’t pack out, enhancing the cushioning of the polyurethane footbed and the non-slip grip outsole’s thick herringbone tread with deep grooves just doesn’t wear down. Durability is an understatement. The Marana was born to skate and hold its own. Just like Ryan.
