Special BIONIC® fabrics, yarn-dyed saturation and a modern urban vibe all converge to create the distinct feel of this versatile bag. PU-coated recycled fabric sheds the elements without looking aggressively tech, while also expressing its style with custom webbing and a signature BIONIC® Bolivian pattern that’s exclusive to Burton. Essential elements such as a padded laptop compartment, external shovel pocket and oversized beverage stash enable it to transition seamlessly from weekend pursuits to daily grind.
