For those of you lucky enough to go to High Cascade Snowboard Camp in the summer, or dedicated enough to camp near some perpetual snow patch, there is the Burton HCSC Shred Scout Pack. It’s got everything you’ll need to haul your glacier-riding gear, including a skate/snowboard carry, sound and goggle pocket, hydration compatibility, and a removable rucksack style closure that converts to a lunch cooler…how sweet…er, cool is that? It even delivers off-snow with skate carry straps, buckles for carrying your boots, and a new stowaway hood to keep your cranium covered. Dang, just look at that features list…there isn’t a backpack in the Burton line that’s as well-equipped as this.
